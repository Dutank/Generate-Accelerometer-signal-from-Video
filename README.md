# Generate-Accelerometer-signal-from-Video
Inspired by UnifyID(https://unify.id/), the most innovative startup of RSA conf. 2017.  
Accelerometer based Gait authentication of smartphone user is very convenient!
Gait is known as safer than fingerprint, iris, hand veins.
Researchers that attack gait authentication system with mimic attack conclude that spoofing is not easy.
Then Gait is perfect biometric? Can it replaces the password and PIN?

I design the experiment whether gait is safe or not.
  1. Analize the working principle of accelerometer of smartphone.
  2. If the principle is based on only the displacement of smartphone, 
     then I can generate accelerometer signal with the displacement.
  3. Find source to get the displacement of smartphone.(I choose camera)
  4. Generate accelerometer signal.
  
From one camera, I can get a 2D information and I can generate 2D accelerometer signal correctly!
From two camera, I can get a 3D information but I am working on extrating depth information from 2 videos.
